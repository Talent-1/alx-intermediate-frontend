  Installing and Initializing Sass in my Project

  I used the following commands to install and initialize Sass in my project:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```
  This command initializes a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file with default settings.

  ```bash
  npm install sass --save-dev
  ```
  This command installs Sass as a development dependency in my project, allowing me to compile SCSS files into CSS.

  After running these commands, I can now use Sass in my project to write and compile stylesheets.

  To compile SCSS files to CSS, I used the following command:

  ```bash
  npx sass source/styles.scss output/styles.css
  ```
  This command takes the `styles.scss` file from the `source` directory and compiles it into a `styles.css` file in the `output` directory.

  After completing these steps, I linked the compiled CSS file in my HTML to apply the styles to my web pages.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="output/styles.css">
  ```
